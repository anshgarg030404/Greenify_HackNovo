# Greenify_HackNovo

We are participating in a hackathon focusing on "Tech for Good," specifically addressing climate action through sustainable solutions and inclusive technology for marginalized communities.

Our project aims to tackle the challenge of making green energy more accessible by offering affordable upgrades for existing housing and infrastructure, rather than solely focusing on new constructions favored by contractors. We propose a platform where users can book appointments with technicians to install sustainable solutions like solar panels at a reduced cost compared to new construction.

Hereâ€™s how it works: Users visit our website and schedule an appointment with a technician. The technician visits their location and uses lidar scanning technology to create a detailed 3D model of the area where solar panels will be installed, ensuring optimal placement and functionality. Based on this model, we provide the client with a cost estimate and a virtual 3D representation of their property with the proposed solar panels.

Once the client approves, technicians are dispatched for installation. Additionally, we offer membership plans for maintenance and real-time monitoring services through a dashboard, ensuring ongoing revenue for the company.

Our goal is to promote sustainability by making eco-friendly upgrades more accessible and affordable, thereby contributing to climate action and supporting marginalized communities through inclusive technology solutions.
